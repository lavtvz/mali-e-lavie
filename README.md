i love my boyfriend more than everything in this worls, his my life, my soul, hes in my mind all the time. I live for him, hes my eternal love, my cute baby, my little and security cat, i love him for ever. I cant live without him, mali is my best friend, my security point, my home, my sweetheart, my dream boy, omg i cant breath if i dont marry with this guy. Hes my groom, my future husband and dad of my childrens. I loved him in the first second of conversation, i love him now and i will love him forever, i know his voice and his thinks by heart like a pretty song, the pretty ive ever seen before.
